## ðŸš€ Project Highlights

- âœ… Custom CNN combined with **MobileNetV2** (transfer learning)
- âœ… Applied **data augmentation** and **dropout** to reduce overfitting
- âœ… Used **focal loss** to handle class imbalance
- âœ… Integrated **callback functions** like ModelCheckpoint and ReduceLROnPlateau
- âœ… Achieved **95% training accuracy** and **85% validation accuracy**
- âœ… Grad-CAM support for **visual explanation** of predictions *(in progress)*
- âœ… Future upgrade to **multi-class classification** *(glioma, meningioma, pituitary)*
